# Hackathon-2024

# Idea: Robot Game
## Subheading


# TODO
1. Hitboxes (matt: I think we can use the pygame-gui module to set up the basic buttons and stuff)
2. Robot and other sprites
3. Upgrades/Multiplier (Steven: I think i have a good idea on how to do these)
4. Spacebar and mouse click event loops
5. Item / upgrade / score display (complete)
6. Game "end" condition
7. Ending code

# Other
Matt: I was thinking that additional to the game, there would be like other buttons that do random stuff (like one button plays music, another button shows some image or something, another does something else, etc.) This could be stuff we consider after completing the core game and would probably require us to call some APIs (Definitely not implemented)

Matt: Idk how to do this but is there a way to save and load data in pygame? So that you can keep playing (Implemented)

# Reference
Matt: I'm using [CS110](https://cs110.stevenamoore.dev/Chapter/ch8/lessonnotes/guiprogramming) as a reference for our folder structure. (Mostly successful)
