# Idea: (tentative) robot clicker game
## Subheading


# TODO

2. Robot and other sprites
3. Upgrades/Multiplier (Steven: I think i have a good idea on how to do these)
4. Spacebar and mouse click event loops
5. pass

# Other
Matt: I was thinking that additional to the game, there would be like other buttons that do random stuff (like one button plays music, another button shows some image or something, another does something else, etc.) This could be stuff we consider after completing the core game and would probably require us to call some APIs
