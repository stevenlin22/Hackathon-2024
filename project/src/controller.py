# Matt: Following what I learned in CS110, we should be following MVC (model, view, controller).
# In this case the models are the structure of the game (sprites, buttons, etc.), the view is pygame, and the controller is this file which initializes and works with the two.

# import necessary files and modules

class Controller:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
